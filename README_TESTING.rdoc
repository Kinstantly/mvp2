= Testing

The goal is to do behavior-driven and test-driven development (BDD and TDD).  I don't always succeed.  Sometimes I write the tests afterwards.  The main thing is to get coverage for all types of functionality.  We're using Rspec and Cucumber.  See 'spec' and 'features' in the repository root.

== Rspec

* https://www.relishapp.com/rspec
* http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book

Everything is in the 'spec' folder.

=== TextMate

* https://github.com/rspec/rspec-tmbundle (TextMate bundle)

To run Rspec from inside TextMate, go to Preferences -> Advanced -> Shell Variables.  Set the following shell variables.

 RUBYOPT rubygems
 TM_RUBY ~/.rvm/bin/rvm-auto-ruby

For the TM_RUBY value, you might have to use the expanded path instead of '~'.

== FactoryGirl

* https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md

Factories are in 'spec/factories'.  There should be a file in there for each model.  If you create a new model, create a factory for it in that folder.

== Cucumber

* http://cukes.info/

Cucumber feature files are in the 'features' folder.  It shares FactoryGirl with rspec, i.e., in 'spec/factories'.

== Capybara

We are using the Capybara DSL for Cucumber.
