/* Used to convert PX to EMs for multiple properties or values or both.
$base is an optional measurement that allows making measurements relative to the parent font size rather than the current. Also accepts a list of lists (instead a list of values) for properties that accept multiple lists of values. Only numbers are converted; everything else is passed through.

Examples:

@include scale(line-height, 30)
@include scale(line-height, 30, 16)
@include scale(width height, 125);
@include scale(padding, 0 25, 16);
@include scale(text-shadow, (#0d6e28 1 1) (#777 0 0 2), 16);
@include scale(box-shadow, (inset 0 0 0 1 #2a9022) (inset 0 0 3 #459966), 16);
