						%p
							It started with a frustrating attempt to find some answers to help one kid having trouble at school. 
						%p
							We googled ADHD and executive function and a bunch of other terms and got something like 46,200,000 results—none of them much help. Then we asked our Facebook friends, got a bunch of names, and called or emailed about 20 therapists and coaches. We got exactly one response. (We couldn't afford her.) We thought: Really? Do other parents find it this difficult to find, say, just the right sleep consultant or speech therapist or college essay coach?
						%p
							To find out, we talked to hundreds of moms and dads from all over the world (including, by Skype, a very nice woman in China) and heard pretty much the same thing from all of them: Yup, it's hard.
						%p
							So we decided to fix it.
