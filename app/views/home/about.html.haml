						%h2 So much info, so little that's life-changing
						%p
							With the world at our scrolling, swiping fingertips, you'd expect the information that makes a real difference to families to be easier to find than ever.
						%p
							But baby horoscopes, celebramom news, and click candy are crowding out the compelling, meaningful stuff parents tell us they're looking for.
						%h2 So many experts, so hard to connect
						%p
							At the same time, the technologies that have made booking a table or getting a ride fast and easy aren't yet working for anyone trying to find someone with the skills to get you through a rough parenting patch or just enrich your family's life.
						%p
							It's too hard to connect with just the right child sleep consultant or flute teacher or ADHD coach&mdash;who's available when you are, at a price you can afford.
						%h2 We want to fix that...
