			%p - We may disclose your information to third parties who provide services to our business, such as email delivery services, payment processing, and customer service. However, they will be required to maintain that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

			%p - We may transfer your information in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution, or other transaction, or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes.
