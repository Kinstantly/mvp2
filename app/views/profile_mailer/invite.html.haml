Have you ever thought there has to be a better way for parents and providers like you to find one another?
%br
%br
After talking to hundreds of parents and providers across the country, we heard that wish expressed over and over&mdash;and we've spent the last 10 months building a solution that we hope you'll love.
%br
%br
We call it Kinstantly. It offers a better, more convenient way for potential clients to find you, learn about you and your services, and&mdash;soon (if you want)&mdash;self-schedule time with you.
%br
%br
To make things as simple as possible, we've already created a profile for you. Take a look:
= link_to 'My profile', mailer_show_profile_to_claim_url(@profile)
%br
%br
And, of course, when you're ready, it's easy to make any changes you'd like. To get started, <i>single-click</i> here:
= link_to 'Claim my profile', claim_user_profile_url(token: @profile.invitation_token)
(Note: You'll first be taken to a sign-in page; it will just take a few seconds to enter your name and email address&mdash;and yes, it's free.)

Please don't hesitate to email me directly (see link below) if you have any questions, concerns, or just want to talk.
