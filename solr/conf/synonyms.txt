#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#some test synonym mappings unlikely to appear in real input text
# aaa => aaaa
# bbb => bbbb1 bbbb2
# ccc => cccc1,cccc2
# a\=>a => b\=>b
# a\,a => b\,b
# fooaaa,baraaa,bazaaa

# Some synonym groups specific to this example
# GB,gib,gigabyte,gigabytes
# MB,mib,megabyte,megabytes
# Television, Televisions, TV, TVs
#notice we use "gib" instead of "GiB" so any WordDelimiterFilter coming
#after us won't split it into two words.

# Synonym mappings can be used for spelling correction too
# pixima => pixma

# The following assumes solr.SynonymFilterFactory has expand="true" and is used at index time.
# Therefore the order of terms within each line does not matter.
